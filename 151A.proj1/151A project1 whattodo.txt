151A project 1 description and what to do
 
obj - combine BISECTION and NEWTONS method - solving eqn in one variable
	1) guaranteed convergence of Bisection method
	2) fast convergence of Newton's method

motivation -
	solve f(x) = 0. 
	- f is differentiable on [a,b]
		- if f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs, then Bisection method converges
		linearly to p, a zero of f
		- if the initial guess for p, which is xo, is 'sufficiently close' to 
		p, then Newton's method converges.
			- if it converges && f'(p) =/= 0, it converges quadratically,
			much faster than bisection method
	//Sometimes, trial and error is needed for a good initial guess. 
	- GOAL: make hybrid approach to automate choice of initial guess for newtons

proposed method: psuedocode already there - algorithm 1, requires two functions:
	1) function [A, B, p] = BISECTION(f, a, b, TOL, imax)
		- takes function f, left and right end points, tolerance, max num of
		iterations; outputs new end points and solution
	2) function [p, flag] NEWTON(f, df, xo, TOL, imax)
		- takes f, f', initial guess, tolerance, max num iterations; output
		solution and flag determining if converged (0 = diverge, 1 = convg)
