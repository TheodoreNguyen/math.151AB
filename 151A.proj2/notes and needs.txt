function 1: construction of cubic splines from 2.2. Provide options to choose NBC and CBC
function 2-n: solve tracking problem
pdf: 
-user guide describing all routines/applications, what they do, and meaning of ea var
-solns data in data.mat. load data. ip are the data pts. test code - plot path of vehicle
-experiments: calculate velocity at each pt in ^^ using cubic splines. This is uo, . un
	Do the but now with the 3-pt midpoint method. This is vo, .. vn
		(the velocity of a vehicle is a 2D vector)
	plot velocity field (vector field) using quiver.
		decide which one is more accruate


summary: what you need:
- function 1 construct cubic splines	
- function 2 solve tracking problem
	(he wants coefficients of the splines as the outputs for both)
- pdf - write all routines and how to use them and stuff
	- plot the path of the vehicle				DONE: xi_xii_vs_yi_yii.png
	- calculate velocity at to, .. tn using cubic splines 	DONE: uo, .. un
					- using 3pt midpoint 	DONE: vo, .. vn
	- plot velocity field u and v in same plot via quiver	DONE: vectorfield_cubicTHEN_midpt.png
	- answer: which one is more accurate probably?	DONE: ux, cuz higher order error term
